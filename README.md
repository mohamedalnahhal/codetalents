# CodeTalents
CodeTalents is a work-in-progress competitive programming platform inspired by sites like Codeforces and AtCoder.
The goal of the project is to create a clean, modern environment where developers can practice algorithmic problems, compete in timed contests, track their progress, and engage with a coding community.
This project is being built as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate full-stack development, system design, APIs and database design.
